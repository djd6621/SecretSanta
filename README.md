## Background
My friends and I wanted to do secret santa but I did not want to go through the process of writing down names and picking from a hat.
So, I decided to create a program which did all the work for us!

## Application Summary
This is a program that when given names will match each name to another name in order to generate a list to use for secret 
santa

## To run
Simply create a run config for the application class and you'll be good to go. The program runs solely using the command line.
